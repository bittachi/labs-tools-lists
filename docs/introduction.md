## Lists Philosophy

Lists is a project hosted on Wikimedia Labs. Its goal is to create a place where it is possible to create, edit, analyze and run easily queries and scripts to create lists of wiki pages.

The lists can be both for human-usage and for bot-usage.

At the moment only SQL queries are supported and are run automatically by the system with a certain frequency.
